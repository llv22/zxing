static zxing iOS library Notes -- by Orlando,Ding 2012-09

1, Reason - in order to simplify zxing integration, for just .a and relevant header integration, without multi-source code project integration

2, How-to
git clone or download zip to your local
* switch to iphone branch
* ./gen.sh <OUT_DIR> - generate .a universal file[i386,arm compatiable] and header file to OUT_DIR

<OUT_DIR>/merged will be your target file
Dings-MacBook-Pro:merged llv22$ ls
libZXingWidget.a	zxingheader
Dings-MacBook-Pro:merged llv22$ ls -all
total 53536
drwxr-xr-x   4 llv22  staff       136 Sep 19 11:25 .
drwxr-xr-x  13 llv22  staff       442 Sep 19 11:25 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 llv22  staff  27408820 Sep 19 11:25 libZXingWidget.a
drwxr-xr-x  20 llv22  staff       680 Sep 19 11:25 zxingheader

* import libZXingWidget.a and zxingheader[recursive header files] into your project

3, sample code - you can refer to QRCodeVerify project
TAKE CARE - .mm is required for zxing cpp compilation

4, futher investigation
* the zxing ZXingWidget UI isn't so nice, you can customized the UIViewController;
* Navigation for scanning isn't so smooth, just change as you like.
